We have added a new feature ["sections"](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View#using-sections) to [Aura.View v2](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View) and released it as [2.0.0-beta2](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View/releases).

This feature is due to the patient lobbying of Hari KT. He saw variations of it in [Plates](http://platesphp.com/templates/sections/) and [Symfony](http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/Templating/Helper/SlotsHelper.html), and figured it would be a nice bit of feature parity to add. He was right.

It also involves a small BC-breaking change. Instead of assigning the inner view content to a template variable, we now store that content internally and expose it via a `getContent()` method. So instead of `echo $this->content_var_name` to place the content in the layout, we now use `echo $this->getContent()`.

Enjoy!
