        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The primary goal of Aura is to provide high-quality, well-tested,
            <a href="http://php-fig.org">standards-compliant</a>, decoupled
            libraries that can be used in any codebase. This means you can use
            as much or as little of the project as you like.

        <h2>Packages</h2>
        <p>
            The Aura project centers around a collection of independent
            packages. Each package is self-contained and has only the things
            it needs for its core purpose. None of the packages depends on any
            of the other; you can download and use each of the packages on its
            own.

        <h2>Framework</h2>
        <p>
            Aura has enough libraries to form a full-stack framework of its
            own. A system repository is available to incorporate them all into
            a coherent framework for application development.
